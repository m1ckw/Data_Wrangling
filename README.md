# SIT220 Data Wrangling

### Deakin University Computer Science Unit
Data wrangling is the process of preparing the raw data appropriately for modelling purposes. 

In this unit we learned various data wrangling methodologies and programming techniques to perform them. 
This includes programming in Python for performing various data wrangling tasks, data extraction methods from different sources, 
working with different types of data, storing and retrieving data, applying sampling techniques and inspecting, 
cleaning data by identifying outliers/anomalies, handling missing data, transforming, selecting and extracting features, 
performing exploratory analysis, visualisation using various tools, summarising data appropriately, 
performing basic statistical analysis and modelling using basic machine learning. Further, 
techniques for maintaining data privacy and exercising ethics in data manipulation was covered.
